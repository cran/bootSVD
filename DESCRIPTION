Title: Fast, Exact Bootstrap Principal Component Analysis for High
        Dimensional Data
Description: Implements fast, exact bootstrap Principal Component Analysis and
    Singular Value Decompositions for high dimensional data, as described in
    <http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0922>. For data matrices that are too large to operate
    on in memory, users can input objects with class 'ff' (see the 'ff'
    package), where the actual data is stored on disk. In response, this
    package will implement a block matrix algebra procedure for calculating the
    principal components (PCs) and bootstrap PCs. Depending on options set by
    the user, the 'parallel' package can be used to parallelize the calculation of
    the bootstrap PCs.
